        <h2>Cash Conversion Cycle <b>OR</b> Operation Cycle</h2>
        <p>The cash conversion cycle (CCC) is a metric that expresses the length of time, in days, that it takes for a company to convert resource inputs into cash flows.<br /> 
        The CCC represents the number of days a firm's cash remains tied up within the operations of the business. A cash flow analysis using CCC also reveals in, an overall manner, how efficiently the company is managing its working capital.<br />
        The CCC is also referred to as <b>the cash cycle</b>, <b>asset conversion cycle</b> or <b>net operating cycle</b>.<br />
        <h3>Calculation</h3>
        <p>The cycle is composed of three main working capital components: Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO), Days sales outstanding (DSO) and Days Payable Outstanding (DPO). It is calculated as follows: </p>
        <p> Inventory conversion period (DIO) <br /><br />
         + Receivable collection period (DSO) <br /><br />
         = Operating cycle<br /><br />
         - Payables deferral period (DPO)<br /><br />
         <b>= Cash conversion cycle</b></p>
        <h3>Interpretation of the outcome</h3>
        <p>The value of the cash conversion cycle is sector dependent. It is recommended to compare the value to industry averages. A firm could even achieve a negative CCC: this means that the company does pay its suppliers for the goods that it buys after it receives payment for selling those goods (see e.g. some retailers).</p>
        <p><img src="IMG/green.png" alt="green" width="24" height="28" />CCC &lt; industry average: a low CCC signifies a well-managed company, and thus can be used to help evaluate potential investments. A small conversion cycle means that a company's money is tied up in inventory for less time. In other words, a company with a small conversion cycle can buy inventory, sell it, and receive cash from customers in less time.</p>
        <p><img src="IMG/orange.png" alt="orange" width="27" height="31" />CCC slightly above industry average: Be careful! This is a warning sign. It can indicates that the company has a big timespan between its disbursing and collecting cash.</p>
        <p><img src="IMG/red.png" alt="red" width="24" height="30" />CCC &gt; industry average: a high CCC indicates a too big timespan between a firm's disbursements to its suppliers and its collection of the cash from its clients. The company will have larger working capital requirements then competitors with a shorter cash conversion cycle.</p>
        <h3>Recommendation </h3>
        <p>Shortening cash conversion cycle frees up cash to reinvest in business or to reduce debt and interest. To achieve this result we refer to the recommendations of:</p>
        <ul><li>Days inventory outstanding</li>
        <li>Days sales outstanding</li>
        <li>Days purchases outstanding</li></ul>
